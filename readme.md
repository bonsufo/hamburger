The aim is to help a burger company manage their process of selling hamburgers.

User stories
1. Create a base hamburger and two other types of hamburgers.
2. All burgers should have bread type and one meat topping.
    1. Bread types: Wholegrain, White, Brioche, Ciabatta
    2. Meat choices : Black angus patty, Kobe beef patty, Vegan patty, Fish patty
3. The basic hamburger should have the following items:
    1. Up to 4 additional toppings (eg. cheese, sauces, lettuce, tomato, union, etc) that the customer can select to be added to the burger.
    2. Each one of these items gets charged an additional price.
    3. So you need some way to track how many items got added.
    4. The burger has a base price and the toppings/additions are all separately priced.
    5. And calculate the final price (base burger with all the toppings/additions).
4. The healthy burger should have the following:
    1. It can have 6 toppings in total.
5. The combo burger should have the following:
    1. Comes with chips and drinks as additions
    2. No (extra) toppings are allowed.
6. All burgers should be able to output:
    1. Base price of the hamburger.
    2. Each topping name.
    3. Topping price.
    4. And a grand total for the burger (base price + all toppings / additions).
